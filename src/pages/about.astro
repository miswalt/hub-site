    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      Hi everyone — I’m Mike Iswalt. Thanks for visiting mikeiswalt.com and exploring
      the apps I’ve created with the help of generative AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve been a consultant for over 20 years in transportation engineering,
      urban planning, and economics in the Bay Area. 
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>

    <p>
      In planning and engineering consulting, clients hire us to solve problems
      and answer questions such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>What is the nature of the problem?</li>
      <li>
        How is the system impacted — is it an issue with demand, capacity,
        or both?
      </li>
      <li>
        What infrastructure should we build, or what policy should we implement?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To answer these questions, we develop forecasts, analyze options,
      and assess their benefits and costs. This is the core analytical
      approach behind much of the work.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Tools Matter</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve focused on making these analyses as accessible
      as possible — not just to clients, but to stakeholders such as state DOTs,
      transit agencies, cities, and the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      Accessibility is key to building trust in results and ensuring that
      decision-makers truly understand the tradeoffs behind recommendations.
    </p>

    <p>
      To support this, I’ve increasingly focused on developing tools built on
      open-source software and delivered through the web — rather than dense
      PDF reports or bespoke desktop applications.
