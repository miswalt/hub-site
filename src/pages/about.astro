        Hi everyone, I’m Mike Iswalt, thanks for visiting my site mikeiswalt.com and the apps I’ve created with the help of Generative AI.

        I’ve been a consultant for over 20 years in the fields of transportation engineering, urban planning, and economics. 

        In planning and engineering consulting, clients hire us to solve problems and answer questions such as:
        - What is the nature of the problem?
        - How is the system impacted? Is it an issue with too much or too little demand or is it an issue with capacity?
        - What infrastructure should we build or what policy should we implement?

        To answer these questions, we need to develop forecasts, analyze options, and assess their benefits and costs. This is a typical analysis approach. 

        Throughout my career I’ve tried to make these analyses we do as accessible to our clients and the consumers of the analysis results such as related stakeholders (state DOTs, transit agencies, cities) and the public. This is key to developing trust in the results and to make sure decision makers understand the results and recommendations.

        To help make analyses as accessible to a broad set of consumers, I’ve focused on developing tools based on open-source software and delivered through the web as opposed to dense pdf reports or results generated by bespoke desktop software.
